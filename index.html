			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img id="headshot" src="assets/images/placeholderBox.jpeg" alt="JDanielPicture" />
			<div id="text">I've worked for the past 10 years developing reporting for all department levels from internal support to C-level officers, as well as individual customers and OEM partners. I've also helped create processes to build successful marketing campaigns in the email and voicemail verticals, also providing voiceover talent for such campaigns. The tools involved in my everyday work include various CRM tools, Microsoft Office (emphasis on Excel and Access), and data queries in SQL/MySQL.

<!-- ISSUE: why does the id "navId" not control the <a> tags in the nav section? I had to write some css for the <a> links. Hmmmm.... 
 ISSUE: why is the picture on the right of the text?
